This site was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It heavily depends on [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/) for styling and responsiveness.

It is statically hosted on [Netlify](http://netlify.com/). Read about enabling redirects on Netlify to fix client-side routing for SPAs [here](https://www.blog.karenying.com/posts/404-react-page-not-found).

A tutorial for the [carousel](https://karenying.com/projects) can be found [here](https://www.blog.karenying.com/posts/adding-transitions-to-a-react-carousel-with-material-ui) and a tutorial for the nav bar can be found [here](https://blog.karenying.com/posts/nav-bar-with-dots).
